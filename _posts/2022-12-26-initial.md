## Intro 
Welcome to my first blog post, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to write so here I will simply ramble on my current projects. Some aspects of the projects are a bit glossed over because I don't feel like going too into detail... wish I had started this earlier as it'd be nice to write posts as I complete steps of the project, but alas. 

## Chess Clock 
For the past few weeks I've been working on a chess clock using a microcontroller, a few buttons, LEDs, and 3D printed enclosure. The chess clock came as an idea from one of my roommates, albeit it was supposed to be a project between the two of us which he prompty abandoned once I asked him to researched some microcontroller fundamentals, but I liked the idea so much that I decided to continue the endevour on my own. Lucas, if you're reading this then you're a lazy bum. 

# Why? 
### I Hate Novelty
I find that a lot of people around me also enjoy making projects, but that my interests often differ from theirs. My roommates want to experiment with computer vision, AI, data management, AR, ugh. I cannot find any motivation to participate in these projects though; they're simply not interesting to me. My best guess is that I'm not exactly interested in novel 'products' or 'ideas' all that much, as I forsee building some shitty tech behind them in an attempt to simply get a proof of concept 'idea' working, instead of making a quality project to practice fundamental skills. I think of side-projects as means by which to practice skills so that they can be applied in the future to increasingly complex projects that demand solid foundations, whether that's at work or at home for fun. It's probably easier (and a more efficient use of time) to make a project to read a serial data stream first than to implement a HTTP server over a serial interface. Practice the fundamentals before stepping into features. 

For example, at work I recently participate in a hack-a-thon that, while literally won us one of the categories, it made me tear my hair out for 3 days straight. A co-worker and I created a set of programs which could translate the pixels in a gif or image into a set of frames that could be written to a dataset of light's that are captured in AR. It worked remarkably well and was really cool.

In order to make the project we literally hacked our company internal GUI's databases to write the data from the python script whipped together over the course of trial, error, and fire. It only worked on mine and my partner's computer, I could barely tell you how it worked, we had to beg people with the actual knowledge of how the company's GUI worked to figure out things for us, sat and brainstormed for a solid day and a half when we had no clue how to make our idea work, then cried tears of joy when the thing actually worked. While it's a cool marketable proof of concept, it sidesteps years of work done at the company that has no actual value given that the entirety of the project can never be replicated because it's such a hack. The frustration that comes from when you're unable to actually anticipate the solution / or platform of solutions by which to implement your project is so awful for me that it really really dissuades me from wanting to work on 'novel' ideas. I don't believe I learned anything from this endevour, just simply made a project. I don't like hackathons, I like writing good code using practices that literally derrive from the frustration that comes from these hackathons. That is not to say that I actually write any good code, but I digress. 

## Implementation 
### Displays
The chess clock is a Teensy 4.0 interfacing with a few buttons and displaying the contents to 2 LED panels comprised of one common cathode 4 digit 7 segment display and one single digit 7 segment display, the single digit for displaying the number of hours left as I wanted the clock mostly functional for classical games (although... it's not compatible for actual FIDE classical time control)... perhaps in the future.

</figure>


I also didn't want to use seven segment driver displays (shown left) because I felt as though it made the project a bit too trivial, and would really just be connecting parts. I knew obviously someone else had figured out how the 4 digit displays worked, but I didn't know how they worked and saw it as a fun challenge to figure out. 

Turns out the displays are very easy to use, the mode of operation is that the 4 digit displays contain 8 "input" lines, which dictate the character to be displayed (7 segments + DP) and 4 "address" lines, which dictate what digit is being referenced. Thus to display a 4 digit number, each digit in the number must be turned on and off individually fast enough for the human eye to not notice, I found that a refresh rate of 2kHz was sufficient. 








### Display Interfacing.  
Obviously having 12 lines for each 4 digit display, and 8 more for each single display was going to add up, so a devised a shift register scheme using the beloved 74HC595. I daisy chained 5 of them together to get a total of 40 bits shifted out. 8 for each digit that would need shifting (4 x 8), and 4 for the addressing. (The left and the right displays could be syncronized to use the same address bits saving 4 bits). The remaining 4 bits are simply an artifact of the fact that they don't make 4 bit shift registers lol. This gets me 40 outputs for 3 GPIO pins woo hoo. 

### Power Supply. 
I decided to go with a recharageable LiPo as I've never actually used one before, but appears simple enough. I got a 2000mAh off of Amazon, a charger from adafruit as seen to the right, and a boost buck to stabalize the output to 5V. the boost buck will feed to a power rail for the arduino, displays and shift registers. 


### Enclosure. 
This one was a bit of a doozy and wish I had done this seperately to talk more about it but alas. This was my first time doing cad since freshman year of undergrad so boy was there a bit to learn all over again. I downloaded a copy of Fusion360 and got to work... and it's pretty simple. My model is not even remotely parametric but I hope that's ok, it came together atleast. I'm stuck at my moms right now with covid over the holidays, but once I get back to da lab in Philly will be able to check the dimensions against all the parts I've made / ordered. 

The model consists of a base and a top shell, as I'll most likely only use the base until all debugging is done, once it's all completed we can seat everything together in the top shell and screw things together. I'd say a bit more, but will leave some for the future, as this post is already too long. Attached are the two enclosure pieces.
